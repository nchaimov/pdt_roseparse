NOTES for APPLE:
================
Please build on 10.7 so binaries will work on 10.8.3+. If you build on Mountain Lion, binaries will not
work on Lion. 
Please use the libstdc++.a and libgcc_eh.a provided in the Apple directory. 

For APPLE, it is very important that $(BOOST_HOME)/lib not contain any .dylib files so boost libraries are
statically linked. Hence, the make clean target has the:
rm -f $(BOOST_HOME)/lib/*.dylib

For Apple, we use perl -p -e 's/,/\n/g' instead of sed. And config/rose_edg_required_macros_and_functions.h 
has a masked declaration of __builtin_bswap64:
#ifndef __APPLE__
long int __builtin_bswap64 (long int x);
#endif

This is roseparse based on the edg4x-rose branch of ROSE.

Before using roseparse, first generate required headers and configuration files by running ./configure.

It uses ROSE_HOME in the Makefile to point to the edg44-rose repo. 
module unload gcc
setenv BOOST_HOME /home9/nchaimov

./configure
make clean
make

It picks up the installed directory (specified explicitly in Makefile) from here:
[sameer@cn180 edg44-roseparse]$ ls -lt ~/edg4x-edgsrc-rose-inst
lrwxrwxrwx 1 sameer cas_cis 38 Mar 14 17:30 /home3/sameer/edg4x-edgsrc-rose-inst -> apps/pdtrose/pkgs/edg4x-rose-installed
