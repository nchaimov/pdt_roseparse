# EDG C/C++ predefined macro definition file.
# 
# The format of the entries in this file is:
# 
# mode,!mode,mode   cannot_redefine   macro_name   macro_value
# 
# - "mode" is a label from the predefined macro modes table.  The macro is
#   defined if the mode is set, or if the mode is not set when "!mode" is
#   used.  The macro is defined if any of the mode tests is TRUE.  The
#   mode table can be customized, but the current set of supported modes is:
# 
#     gnu:        gcc or g++ mode
#     gcc:        gcc mode
#     gpp:        g++ mode
#     microsoft:  Microsoft mode
#     strict:     strict C or C++ mode
#     cpp:        any C++ mode
#     all:        all modes
# 
# - cannot_redefine indicates whether the predefined macro may later be
#   redefined.  The value must be "yes" or "no".
# 
# - macro_name is the name of the macro to be defined.
# 
# - macro_value is the value to which the macro should be defined.  All of
#   the characters until the end of the line are used as the macro value.
# 
# See also the make_predef_macro_table script in the "misc" directory,
# which can create this file for a given version of the gcc compiler.
